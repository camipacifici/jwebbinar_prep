    "\n",
    "Welcome to JWST Data Analysis Tools (JDAT) demonstration of Mosviz, a Multi-Object Spectrograph visualziation tool built atop the Jdaviz framework. This notebook will demonstrate some of the features we've built into Mosviz to facilitate the specialized usecase of MOS analysis. To learn more about Mosviz, see our [Mosviz Documentation](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mosviz/index.html). To learn more about the Jdaviz framework and how you can build your own tool for your usecase, see our [Jdaviz Documentation](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/)\n",

The following demonstration explores the NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy dataset observed.

    "\n",
    "The Mosviz Table Viewer displays all of the different dispersed spectra cutouts for each target identified in the field of view. To switch between targets, you can click on the corresponding row. For this exercise, we'll be looking at the source with the identifer of 158. Navigate to this target using the table viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visually identify the emission feature\n",
    "You can find an assortment of tools in the Toolbox icon in the upper-left corner of each viewer. Amongst them you can find a series of pan/zoom tools, including a bidirectional and individual axis panning and zooming. Using these tools, zoom into the spectral feature around 1.4um in the 1D spectral viewer. As you zoom around, you will notice the first-of-many MOS features we've built into Mosviz: linked data viewers. As the field of view is adjusted in either the 1D or 2D spectral viewer, the other viewer will synchronously pan and zoom as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the feature more visible in the 2D spectral viewer, we'll need to adjust the stretch to the correct levels. To do this, open the Plot Options menu, select the 2D spectrum viewer, then modify the stretch \"min\" value to 0 and the \"max\" value to 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the Specviz tools to identify the redshift\n",
    "One of the great strengths of the Jdaviz Framework is the cross-compatibility and availability of the plugins! The 1D viewer has all the same tools you saw during the Specviz demonstration. As such, we have access to the line-identification plugins here in Mosviz as well! Let's try to identify the redshift using the Line List plugin\n",
